            <p>
                Hollow Knight is an action adventure video game developed and published by Team Cherry released in 2017.
                The game starts simply with little exposition. All you know is that you are a bug, and you must explore. After
                a brief tutorial level, you find a small town named Dirtmouth with only one inhabitant, Elderbug, who explains
                that they don't see many visitors these days; but the few they do see are only passing through before they descend
                into the expansive caverns below. Bugs descend for a variety of reasons, like treasure or adventure, or for some
                simply because they feel a calling. Our blank-faced protagonist gives no insight towards their motivation before
                they themselves leave the comfort of Dirtmouth and descend to the darkness below.
