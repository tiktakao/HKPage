            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p class="whatText">
                Hollow Knight is an action adventure video game developed in Unity by
                <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/"><b>Team Cherry</b></a>
                which released in 2017.
                The game starts simply with little exposition. All you know is that you are a bug, and you must explore. After
                a brief tutorial level, you find a small town named Dirtmouth with only one inhabitant, Elderbug, who explains
                that they don't see many visitors these days; but the few they do see are only passing through before they descend
                into the expansive caverns below. Bugs descend for a variety of reasons, like treasure or adventure, or for some
                simply because they feel a calling. Our blank-faced protagonist gives no insight towards their motivation before
                they themselves leave the comfort of Dirtmouth and descend to the darkness below.
                <br><br>
                The game has an average play time of 27 hours, but the current world record for an Any% glitchless run is <b>31m 24s</b>.

                The world of Hallownest was once occupied by bugs of different factions; but everything changed with the
                arrival of the Pale King, the reincarnation of a felled wyrm. Wyrms are higher beings and are capable of not only
                coherent thought, but a certain level of precognition. The Pale King came to Hallownest with the goal of uniting
                this land under one kingdom. Some lands knelt before others.
                The Mosskin of Greenpath and the Mushroom Clan of the Fungal Wastes admired the
                kings intelligence and pledged allegiance immediately. Within these same wastes lived the Mantis Tribe. While they value
                intelligence, they far preferred their own autonomy. The Pale King struck a deal that they main remain sovereign if
                they kept the Spider Tribe of Deepnest at bay from invading the rest of Hallownest. However, gaining the following
                of the Moth Tribe would prove to be the downfall of The Pale King.<br><br>
                The Moth Tribe worshipped the god Radiance. They quickly flocked to the Pale King. Soon Radiance began to be
                forgotten but before that could happen they infected the minds of the bugs of Hallownest through the dream realm.
                This infection made empty husks of the bugs that had once been granted higher thought by the Pale King. The subjects
                of the Pale King tried everything to combat this infection, but with no success. The Pale Kings came up with a plan.
                He fathered hundreds of children and threw the clutch into the abyss below the City of Tears. Here lived a sinister element
                they only called Void. The Pale King hoped for a perfect child to hatch who was filled with Void. Within this vessel
                the Pale King hoped to trap Radiance and contain the source of this infection.<br><br>

<!--The breakout concept for me during the making of this assignment was margin vs padding, and relative size. I made this assignment to look
good at 100% scale; but when I opened my project on either of my monitors or on my laptop, it always looked different.
I looked at a few websites and noticed what they look like when you zoom in and out. To get a similar affect I set the size
of each container to an absolute value, and then set the elements within those containers as relative values of those absolute
values.-->
